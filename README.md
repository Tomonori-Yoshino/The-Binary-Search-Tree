# The-Binary-Search-Tree
Demonstrates basic functions needed to implement the binary search tree.
This includes insert, write, constructor, and destructor functions. Insert and write functios are implemented as using recursive algorithm 
as well as iterative algorithm. It is prohibited to copy and assign the binary tree here for the purpose of ease. 


# CSZNode
This is the node constructing the binary search tree. Each node has the private three private attributes, including the object of CityStateZip, left pointer, and right pointer. 


# CityStateZip
This is used as the private attribute for the CSZNode. Each object of this class contains the name of the city, state, and the zipcode.
